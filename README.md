# bengali-g2p
Python based G2P module for Bangla

This is a work in progress. The script maps graphemes to an intermediate xipa notation 
I've made up, along with a few archiphonemes which should ultimately be resolved to 
actual phonemes once the rules are all in place. The xipa will be post-processed to actual IPA
and XSAMPA notations in a secondary step (not yet implemented).

Current accuracy metrics: 25/31 = 80.65%
